\begin{itemize}
\item Shell variables are variables maintained by the shell
\item \texttt{FOO=1} sets the value of variable \texttt{FOO} to \texttt{1}
\item No spaces around the \texttt{=} and if the value has a space, it
  should be quoted. (e.g. \texttt{FOO=''Brian Kernighan''}).
\item Can be accessed later using the \texttt{\$} sigil. e.g. \texttt{\$\{FOO\}}
\item Variables are expanded inside double quotes (\texttt{``}). Not
  inside \texttt{'}
\item Subshells will not have copies of the variable unless exported
  (e.g. \texttt{export FOO})
\item Some special variables
