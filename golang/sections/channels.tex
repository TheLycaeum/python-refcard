\subsection{Channels}
\textit{channels} allow you to send messages. Created using \texttt{make}.
The \texttt{<-} operator reads out of a channel and \texttt{->} writes into it.
Channels block when they're full or when there's no data to read.
\begin{lstlisting}
// Channel has a buffer size of 2
ch := make(chan int, 2)
// Send two messages
ch <- 1
ch <- 2
// Read them out
fmt.Println(<-ch)
fmt.Println(<-ch)
\end{lstlisting}

An unbuffered channel (\texttt{make (chan int)}) blocks till there's a reader or data to be read.
