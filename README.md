Reference cards
===============

Reference cards for various tools and technologies. These are used for
my courses the The Lycaeum and also as handouts at various public
workshops that I conduct. 

Build instructions
==================
To build the refcard for a certain tool, go into that directory
(e.g. `golang`) and type `make`. The build process will generate a PDF
of the language or tool in question.
